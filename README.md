About Project.

This project is a real time shopping-cart app. You can add shopping lists and on each shopping list you can add items, mark it as purchase and delete. I did not put an edit button for the items because from a ux perspective it didn't make sense as it is a single item with nothing associated to it, so deleting it and adding a new item will be just as fast as editing an updating it. You can however edit the shop list itself. You can collaborate with a user by adding them by email. After adding the collaborator through their email; the  shopping list should appear on their lists. Once you add collaborator by email, the users can add , delete and mark items on real time.

Things I didn't know.

This project forced me to learn a lot of new things that I had not done before, I know how to use node.js and other backend tools, and I know how to use react.js; however I had never integrated those two together prior to this project. I had also never created a real time app before so it took me some time to familiarize myself with socket.io and implement it in my project. The biggest issue I had; however was deploying, while deploying them together is simple and fast once you know how to do it; trying to figure that out itself caused some issues because I ran into problems that wasn't talked about too much over the internet.

Issues.

Due to having to learn new things within a week, there are a few things that I wasn't able to do the way I would have liked. I would have liked flash messages upon, sign in, sign up, collaboration, error etc. Normally I use the flash npm package for flashing messages; however because I had never used it in react, I wasn't able to learn it and integrate it within the time frame. I have written some tests for the project that I used to showcase that I am able to run tests; however I wasn't able to test everything because of the 1 week time frame.

What I would have done differently?
There are a few things that I would have done differently. I would have added more tests to test everything thoroughly before deployment, I would added flash messages and I would have had a more interesting design.

UI

I used mostly bootstrap and some css for my projects UI.
